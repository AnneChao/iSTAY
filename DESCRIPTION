Description: Provides functions to to compute a continuum 
        of information-based measures for quantifying the 
        temporal stability of populations, communities, and 
        ecosystems, as well as their associated synchrony, 
        based on species (or species assemblage) biomass or 
        other key variables. When biodiversity data are available, 
        the spackage also enables the assessment of the corresponding 
        diversityâ€“stability relationships. All measures are 
        applicable in both temporal and spatial contexts. The 
        theoretical and methodological background is detailed in Chao 
        et al. (2025)  <doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.20.671203> for more details.
